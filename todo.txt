FEATURE TODO:
[] add sphere rendering
[x] generic mesh handling
[] cube mapping
[] proper skybox
[] grid floor
[] object skinning??
[] convert to using a world chunk and offset system instead of absolute floats (will require big changes
  because the renderer origin will need to move around and not be 1:1 with the world origin)

THINGS TO FIX/TWEAK:


8/31/2023:
- basic pipeline of dealing with textures is set up but still getting a black screen
- found an error where texture size allocation was based on number of pixels (dim*dim) and not bytes (dim*dim*4), not sure if there are more like this still
- double check texture buffer is init'ed properly (almost done)
- check if textures and samplers are being set via renderdoc
- check if tex coords are right via renderdoc

9/1/2023
- fixed issues from 8/31/2023, problem was not creating the d3d resource views when loading the texture in render.cpp

9/2/2023
- set registers for viewproj matrix in shader, make sure offsets are still working in constant buffer, hook up second?? constant buffer for viewproj

9/8/2023
- working on differentiating meshes with/without textures by making alpha>1.0f mean the mesh is textured and the value above 1.0f is the blend amount
	this requires changes in dulce.cpp, render.cpp, dulce_dx3d11.cpp, and the shaders to branch

9/18/23
- test WFConverter
- write loader for DOF

10/2/23
- finish making asset table to read data from asset config in

10/20/23 TODO L145 wfobj_loader.h

10/25/23 get stb truetype working, 2D UI shader, Rendering pipe for text
